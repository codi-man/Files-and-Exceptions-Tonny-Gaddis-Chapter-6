8 - When working with this type of file, you can jump directly to any piece of data in the file without reading the data that comes before it: direct access
9 - This is a small “holding section” in memory that many systems write data to before writing the data to a file: buffer

7 - You can have more than one except clause in a try/except statement: True
8 - The else suite in a try/except statement executes only if a statement in the try suite raises an exception: False
9 - The finally suite in a try/except statement executes only if no exceptions are raised by statements in the try suite: False
